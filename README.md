# Katalon Web Automation – The Internet (Heroku)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **Web UI Automation Testing project** built using **Katalon Studio**. The automation is implemented on a public demo website **The Internet (Heroku App)**, which is commonly used for practicing and validating automation strategies.

This project is designed as a **Mid-Level QA Automation portfolio**, focusing not only on basic automation execution but also on **test design quality, maintainability, reusability, and clear test coverage**. It demonstrates how automation supports regression testing and improves overall product quality in an Agile environment.
